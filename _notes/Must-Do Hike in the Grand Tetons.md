title: A Must-Do Hike in the Grand Tetons
---
I recently returned from a trip to Grand Teton National Park, and I have to tell you about this amazing hike. If you're planning a visit, there's one trail you simply cannot miss: **Inspiration Point!**

We started at Jenny Lake, where we parked our car. The crystal-clear water of the lake was stunning. We chose to walk around the lake, which added to our hiking distance but offered beautiful views along the shoreline.

Hiking around the lake was just difficult enough to be a challenge, while still enjoyable. By the end, we were pretty exhausted and out of water, but the anticipation of the view at the top kept us going.

Upon reaching Inspiration Point, we were greeted with a panoramic view that truly lived up to its name. It's easy to see why this spot has become a favorite among hikers and photographers alike.

On our way back down, we took a short detour to Hidden Falls. The thundering cascade was a refreshing sight and sound after our climb. It's a perfect spot to rest and refuel before continuing your journey.

Instead of hiking all the way back, we opted for a scenic boat ride across Jenny Lake. A one-way ticket was $12, but we thought it was worth it. This not only gave our legs a welcome rest but also provided a different perspective of the landscape we'd just hiked through.

Whether you're a seasoned hiker or a casual nature lover, this trail should be at the top of your Grand Teton itinerary.

Tips for hikers:

1. Start early to avoid crowds and afternoon heat.
2. Bring plenty of water and snacks. (We definitely needed more!)
3. Wear sunscreen and good hiking shoes.
4. Don't forget your camera â€“ the views are truly spectacular!
5. Consider taking the boat one way to save time and energy.
